<PRE>Update of /cvsroot/packware/pwbuilder/doc/guide
In directory sheep:/tmp/cvs-serv15405/doc/guide

Added Files:
	DESTDIR FILES HAVE PWBUILD PWINFO SUBPACKAGES VARIABLES 
	janosik.pwinfo slack-desc 
Log Message:
- Initial commit.


--- NEW FILE: DESTDIR ---
pwbuilder automatically sets some variables for make install called by
_install. Those variables include:

DESTDIR=${pkg}
INSTALLROOT=${pkg}
INSTALL_ROOT=${pkg}
PERL_INSTALL_ROOT=${pkg}
INSTALL_PREFIX=${pkg}

Thus it's not required to put in .pwbuilds commands like:

_i_opt DESTDIR=${pkg}

If for some reason these definitions break make install, you can turn them off
by passing -u option to _install.

--- NEW FILE: FILES ---
*.pwbuild

Main building script. The file doesn't need (though it might, better not) to
be executable. Name of this file doesn't need to be related to package name
in any way. Available commands has been described in PWBUILD file.

*.pwinfo

A file with informations about package (description etc.) Name of this file
should be the same as package name. Details in PWINFO file.

*.pwsub

A list of files and directories belonging to a subpackage. Name of this file
should be the same as subpackage name. If there is &quot;_sub NAME&quot; command in
.pwbuild script, there must be NAME.pwsub file (additionally there might be
NAME.pwinfo, too).

*.pw-postinst

A script that will be included in package as install/doinst.sh file and
executed when installing the package. Name of this file should be the same as
name of package or subpackage.

--- NEW FILE: HAVE ---
There are commands available for .pwbuild script that allow to check installed
software. Examples include:

_have_openssl &amp;&amp; _c_opt --with-openssl
_have_mysql &amp;&amp; _c_opt --with-mysql

_have_* commands return 0 if software exists, or 1 if it doesn't. To know what
_have_* commands are available, look into /usr/lib/pwbuilder/include/have
directory.

_have_* commands have been used ie. in php or sylpheed-claws packages.

--- NEW FILE: PWBUILD ---
_doc [-d] [-b subdirectory] [-r directory] [-s N] [-x file] [files]

Points to files that will be put as documentation in
/usr/doc/${name}-${version} directory. Files are separated with space. Their
location is relative to source directory. This command can be used many times.

-d - automatically select files whose names have all letters upper-case.
ABOUT-NLS file will be copied, too. With this option you can still define
addtional files in a normal way.

-b subdirectory - look for -d files in given subdirectory rather that top
level directory of sources.

-s N - the default source if the first one. This option allows to change the
source number.

-x file - exclude file from automatically selected files. This option can be
used many times.

-r directory - defines a directory that the files will be put in. It will be
/usr/doc/${directory} instead of /usr/doc/${name}-${version}.

_doc command is available since version 0.6.0 of pwbuilder.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_source [-f] [-p proj] [-t dir] [-g] [-z] [-u] [-m md5] [-n name] [-v ver] [-i] [url]

Adds new source. File location can be given as URL address that begins with
<A HREF="http://">http://</A> or <A HREF="ftp://.">ftp://.</A> If URL ends with '/', file name is set automatically this
way: '${name}-${version}.tar.bz2'.

-g - use '.tar.gz' rather than '.tar.bz2' when setting file name automatically.

-z - use '.tgz' rather than '.tar.bz2' when setting file name automatically.

-Z - use '.zip' rather than '.tar.bz2' when setting file name automatically.

-n string - use ${string} instead of ${name} when setting file name
automatically.

-v string - use ${string} instead of ${version} when setting file name
automatically.

-m md5 - sets md5 checksum for file. This checksum is used to verify file
before unpacking.

-t dir - changes top directory of source. Default is file name without
extension.

-u - causes source not to be unpacked, even if there is such possibility.

-f - tells pwbuilder that a source can be obtained for SourceForge. URL is not
needed then and is formed automatically in this way:
<A HREF="http://unc.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/${name">http://unc.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/${name</A>}/${name}-${version}.tar.bz2.
If -g option is used, .tar.gz version will be fetched instead of .tar.bz2 one.

-p proj - if -f option is used, and a source is in other directory than ${name}
(a directory after /sourceforge/ is different), this option will let you
overwrite name of this directory.

-s size - size of source. It will be displayed after &quot;+ Source &quot; label.

-c - when autocompleting source location, use an underscore instead of a dash
to join ${name} and ${version}.

_qconf_fix file

Fixes a problem with Makefiles generated by qconf with ../ bug.

file - buggy Makefile

--- NEW FILE: PWINFO ---
In a directory that contains .pwbuild script, one can put ${name}.pwinfo file,
where ${name} is a value of name variable in .pwbuild script.

In .pwinfo file, some variables should be defined. They include:

info - short description of package, half line long.

desc - longer description.

desc field is automatically formated during building package. A way of
formatting is illustrated by attached files. File janosik.pwinfo is an example
of such file. File slack-desc is an output file, generated from janosik.pwinfo.
slack-desc can't have more than eleven lines. One paragraph should be written
in one line, without breaking a line.

--- NEW FILE: SUBPACKAGES ---
pwbuilder has an ability to create subpackages. First, in .pwbuil script there
should be _sub command to define a subpackage, ie.:

_sub libgadu

and the subpackage will be named ${subpackage}, not ${name}-${subpackage}.
Second is to define a list of files and directories that will get into the
subpackage. It is done by creating ${subpackage}.pwsub file. Example content:

/usr/include
/usr/lib
/usr/doc/ekg-${version}/api.txt
/usr/doc/ekg-${version}/protocol.html
/usr/doc/ekg-${version}/functions.txt

As you can see, we can use variables defined in .pwbuild. And they are not only
name, version and build variables, but any variables declared in .pwbuild
script. Warning: names of variables must be enclosed in {} brackets, we can't
write just $version.
Optionally, we can create .pwinfo files for subpackages, named
${subpackage}.pwinfo.

Full ekg package source that makes use of subpackages feature can be found
in out CVS.

--- NEW FILE: VARIABLES ---
tmp - temporary directory unique for every pwbuilder process.

pkg - directory that will be used as install root for a package. Content of
this directory will become package content.

doc - directory ${pkg}/usr/doc/${name}-${version} with package documentation.

docdir - equals to /usr/doc/${name}-${version}.

src - directory that contains .pwbuild script.

srcN - directories with sources that was added by _source command (N = 1...).

srcx - recently defined srcN.

slackver - version of existing Slackware (8.0, 8.1, 9.0, etc.).

slackver_a - first part of full version (7, 8, 9, etc.).

slackver_b - second part of full version (0, 1 etc.).

slackver_c - third part of full version (0, 01 etc.).

slackver_max - full version, equals to
${slackver_a}.${slackver_b}.${slackver_c} (np 8.0.0, 8.1.0, 9.0.0 etc.).
